* Version 2.0 (2012-09-25)

  - A new relational format as the primary data format (directory
    'rels'), partially replacing the lists in the previous version.
    See the file rels/README_rels for more information.

  - Extended beyond being a translation of Princeton WordNet by adding
    new synsets as hyponyms of existing synsets (without glosses and
    English translations). The new synsets correspond to senses of
    common Finnish compound words.

  - Added thousands of new word senses and corrected hundreds of
    existing ones.

  - Change statistics, compared with the previous version (1.1.2):

                                added  removed  corrected
