FinnWordNet
-----------

FinnWordNet is a wordnet for Finnish. It was created by having
professional translators translate the word senses of the Princeton
WordNet (PWN) 3.0 into Finnish and by combining the translations with
the PWN structure. FinnWordNet is a part of the FIN-CLARIN
infrastructure project:

    https://www.kielipankki.fi/organization/fin-clarin/

The FinnWordNet project was active in 2010–2012 and was led by
Research Director, Dr Krister Lindén at the then Department of Modern
Languages (Language Technology) of the University of Helsinki.
