WordNet 3.0 Grind modified for FinnWordNet
==========================================


This package contains the WordNet 3.0 Grind program modified to
support FinnWordNet data.


FinnWordNet
-----------

FinnWordNet is a wordnet for Finnish. For more information about
FinnWordNet, please see

Modifications to Grind
----------------------

The modifications to WordNet 3.0 Grind are the following:

* Support for words encoded in UTF-8.

* Support for words containing various punctuation characters not
  allowed in the original.

* Support for quoting special characters in words with a backslash.

* Option -X to disregard in indexing XML tags or elements in words.

The modifications are made in the source files in directory src/grind.
They are marked with comments beginning "FiWN:".

The modified Grind can be used to compile the original Princeton
WordNet dictionary data files as well as FinnWordNet files.


Compiling
---------

The modified Grind is compiled in the same way as the original Grind
in a Unix, Linux or other similar system. Please refer to the file
INSTALL for installation instructions.

Compiling the program produces a number of warnings, mainly due to the
age of the original Grind. The warnings can be ignored.

The modified Grind requires GLib 2.0 library for UTF-8 support.
Otherwise its requirements are the same as for the original Grind. GNU
Autotools (Automake and Autoconf) or compiler construction tools (lex
or flex, yacc or Bison) are not required unless you modify the source
code.


Known bugs
----------

The modified Grind contains a few known bugs or deficiencies:

* If several different words in the same synset have the same indexed
  form (e.g., because of XML elements), each of them gets the a
  separate but same offset in the index file, resulting in
  non-consecutive sense numbers shown by the wn search program.

* The GLib library used for UTF-8 case conversions is not tested for
  in the configuration phase.

* Using the GLib functions for UTF-8 case conversions leaks memory.

* When converting head adjectives to lowercase, also the XML tags
  included in them get converted.

* Even though the modified Grind supports parentheses in words, the
  search program wn does not search for them properly.
