The attached TSV file summarizes in total 2698 annotations for 980 targets in context. 
This data thus averages 2.75 independently judged annotations for each target. 
The data contains the following TAB-separated fields:

    IDENTIFIER    JUDGMENTS    ASPECTS    LEFT-CONTEXT    TARGET    RIGHT-CONTEXT

Where IDENTIFIER is an identifier for the case, 
JUDGMENTS is a comma-separated list of your sentiment judgments (e.g. "positive,positive,neutral"), 
ASPECTS is a comma-separated list of aspects you annotated (e.g. "laatu,status,status"), 
LEFT-CONTEXT is the text appearing before the target of the annotation, 
TARGET is the text of the target, and 
RIGHT-CONTEXT is the text appearing after the target.
